Pixelize the UI style.

## Changes:
- Modify partial map pixelization
- Hidden the scroll bar
- Change the map difference to the adjacent value difference  
- Support pixel font (Due to technical constraints, you need to manually find the zpix.ttf font file in the corresponding mod folder and install it to view it. Of course, this is optional.)
